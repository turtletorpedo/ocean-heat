# 🌊 Ocean Heat Visualization

An interactive web application that visualizes the shocking reality of ocean heat accumulation due to climate change.

## 🎯 **Mission**

To raise awareness about the catastrophic misinformation around ocean heating by presenting undeniable, factual data from respected climate science organizations.

## 📊 **Key Facts**

- **91%** of excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases goes to oceans
- **>90%** of warming on Earth over past 50 years has occurred in the ocean
- **63%** of total stored heat increase since 1971-2010 comes from warming upper oceans

## 🚀 **Get Started**

Visit the live application at: [https://yourusername.github.io/ocean-heat/](https://yourusername.github.io/ocean-heat/)

## 🛠️ **Features**

- **Interactive Climate Timeline** - Explore ocean heat content trends from 1950s to present
- **Personal Impact Calculator** - See how much heat has accumulated since your birth year
- **Real-Time Data Animation** - Dynamic visualization of heat gain statistics
- **Climate.gov Sourced** - Data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information
